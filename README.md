# Healthcare-Data-System

## Current problem:
The basic helath record information is not transparency, not mobile and not integrity.
it is quite difficult to get your basic health record (at most 40 working days + extra payment) from public hospital/private clinic(maybe shorter time in private clinic)

### Reference: 
(one real example - April 25, 2020) <br>

<br>
In this case, we don't have the platform to save our health record.
if we go to the place and need to provide the realted health record, we will need to check again and spend time to record on paper.

We believe information transparency is essential to tackling the covid pandemic, and to increase the resilience of our healthcare system to future outbreak responses.

## Solution:
We will develop the platform for public between stakeholders: public hospitals/clinics, private practitioners, immigration department, old age homes/hostels, CHP, transportation companies in order to store the basic health record.

## Luanch location:
Hong Kong

## Function:
1. Input (data collection)

1.1 People can make a record for their daily health condition such as body temperature, sick symptom, medicine usage and so on.

1.2 Family doctor/Clinic/Hospital can update the people health information in the system when they have body check.

1.3 Organization/Company/Government Department can upload the people health information in the system when people have been done the health record such as body temperature check at the entrance gate/door.

1.4 IOT device. Some of the smart device can check our health status, and those data is important for us to monitor our health.

2. Output (provide data)

2.1 Notification message For example: One of the student from ABC School got the COVID-19, the system will notify the people from specific group in order to let them know the case and 
(1) notify them to stay at home and to pay more attention on their body condition. 
(2) notify local government/organization to do some action such as cleaning the place, arranging people who have high risk on COVID-19 to do related body check at specific hospital when need.

2.2 Generate report for public health issue. For example: (1)How many people got COVID-19, the number of case from areas and related information. (2) personal health report in order to show your condition.

2.3 Retrieve specific record. For example: The doctor can check the specific patient health record in the system when needs.
The ecosystem will offer the comprehensive data storage and usage of your health record.

## Privacy Issue:
1. Donâ€™t collect the sensitive information from people such as detailed address, ID card number, real name and so on

2. Only collect the health record, medicine info, and COVID-19 related information.

it may not provide the absolutely accurate record from your self-check/ non-medical organization, we may know that the medical device may be have different results based on their quality, but it can provide the reference for doctor diagnosis or general usage.
